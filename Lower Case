In these days kids are introduced to computers at a very early age and in some schools the dictation test is conducted using computers. The kids type their name by using uppercase and lowercase. The teachers found it and asked the 12th class students who are learning C programming to convert the kids name to lower case. And they took up the task of converting the name to lowercase. Can you please help them out?
